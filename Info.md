we are building a system that can convert waste into money.
brief idea description is we collect the waste materials from 
malls, hospitals, and public gathering centers. during the segregation state, we use our software as well as some hardware to collect the data like 
"Which company bottle is this ?","which company hair oil is this?"
also, we have the data of the waste collected from which area.
then we can create clear information about how much people use that product. This idea is in a progression state. Also, we are working on a project for complete waste management. This idea is a part of our complete waste management.
we all know that bulk data is useless. But we convert it to information it is very useful.
information is wealth...
