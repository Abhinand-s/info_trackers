Design idea of how to track waste
1. we collect how much waste is dumped in our dustbin and mall-like sector we calculate the average waste
2. After we collect the waste we use our program to identify the waste categories 
we use a camera and other accessories in the segmentation stage
3. After we collect the data, that data is going to cross-match with existing data and added to the database where we store the  data
